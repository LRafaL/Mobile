# Mobile App Testing

This section is dedicated to testing the mobile application [Shopping List]( https://appdistribution.firebase.google.com/pub/i/ef0e71eeb4f2d6a5), which allows the user to create a task list for organizing and managing daily tasks.
Here I also present my practical work with Charles Proxy and the mobile version of the application [demoshopping.ru]( https://demoshopping.ru/).
I prepared the following documentation and completed the tasks:
